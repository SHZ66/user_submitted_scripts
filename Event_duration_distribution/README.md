# Python script for plotting event duration time distribution
In the main script, specify the direct.h5 file from your analyzed
WESTPA simulation and hte total number of iterations, final state
and tau value in nanoseconds. Running the script will produce a plot
titled durations.pdf. Example direct.h5 file is provided from the
100 iteration long Basic NaCl WESTPA tutorial.
