# Python script for plotting event duration time distribution
In the main script, written by Alex Degrave (ajd98), specify 
the direct.h5 file from your analyzed WESTPA simulation and the 
total number of iterations, final state and tau value in nanoseconds. 
Running the script will produce a plot titled durations.pdf. Example 
direct.h5 file is provided from the 100 iteration long Basic 
NaCl WESTPA tutorial.
