You need to first run the split/merge scheme using "build_state_dist_bb.py" and then initialize the WE 
simulation using "w_custom_init.py" which uses the output from "build_state_dist_bb.py" (and a sample pdb
file for the whole system). After w_custom_init.py the rest works like a regular WESTPA simulation.
